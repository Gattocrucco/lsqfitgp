# lsqfitgp

Python module to do inference with Gaussian processes. Features:

  * Based on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).
  * Interoperates with [gvar](https://github.com/gplepage/gvar) and
    [lsqfit](https://github.com/gplepage/lsqfit) to facilitate inexpert users.
  * Recursively structured covariates.
  * Apply arbitrary linear transformations to the processes, finite and
    infinite.
  * Small [PPL based on Gaussian
    copulas](https://gattocrucco.github.io/lsqfitgp/docs/reference/copula.html)
    to specify the hyperparameters prior.
  * [Rich
    collection](https://gattocrucco.github.io/lsqfitgp/docs/reference/kernelsref.html)
    of covariance functions.
  * Good GP versions of
    [BART](https://gattocrucco.github.io/lsqfitgp/docs/reference/bayestree.html#lsqfitgp.bayestree.bart)
    (Bayes Additive Regression Trees) and
    [BCF](https://gattocrucco.github.io/lsqfitgp/docs/reference/bayestree.html#lsqfitgp.bayestree.bcf)
    (Bayesian Causal Forests).
  
See [this report](https://www.giacomopetrillo.com/scuola/gppdf.pdf) for the
theory behind lsqfitgp.

## Installation

Python >= 3.8 required. Then:

```
$ pip install lsqfitgp
```

## Documentation

The complete manual is available online at
[gattocrucco.github.io/lsqfitgp/docs](https://gattocrucco.github.io/lsqfitgp/docs).
All the code is documented with docstrings, so you can also use the Python help
system directly from the shell:

```python
>>> import lsqfitgp as lgp
>>> help(lgp)
>>> help(lgp.something)
```

or, in an IPython shell/Jupyter notebook/Spyder IDE, use the question mark
shortcut:

```
In [1]: lgp?

In [2]: lgp.something?
```
