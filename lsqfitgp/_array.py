    JAX-friendly imitation of a numpy structured array.
    
    It behaves like a read-only numpy structured array, with the exception that
    you can set a whole field/subfield.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.empty(3, dtype=[('f', float), ('g', float)])
    >>> a = StructuredArray(a)
    >>> a['f'] = np.arange(3) # this is allowed
    >>> a[1] = (0.3, 0.4) # this raises an error
        
    Parameters
    ----------
    array : numpy array, StructuredArray
        A structured array. An array qualifies as structured if
        ``array.dtype.names is not None``.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The StructuredArray is a readonly view on the input array. When you
    change the content of a field of the StructuredArray, however, the
    reference to the original array for that field is lost.
