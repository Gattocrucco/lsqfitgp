Installation
============

First, you have to get a working Python interpreter. There are two main
options: the official package from `<https://www.python.org>`_, and the `Spyder
IDE <https://www.spyder-ide.org>`_. The latter is probably the easier one.

Then, install :mod:`lsqfitgp` by running this command in a shell:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install lsqfitgp

I've seen that people may have problems installing the dependency :mod:`gvar`
on Windows. This page may help:
