User guide
==========

This guide is intended for an audience that has little to none experience with
gaussian processes, and a basic knowledge of Python and Numpy. It is
recommended to read the sections in order. If you prefer bare code examples,
look at the `examples directory
<https://github.com/Gattocrucco/lsqfitgp/tree/master/examples>`_ in the
repository.
