lsqfitgp
========

This is the documentation for the python module :mod:`lsqfitgp`. It provides a
simple but powerful interface to use gaussian processes for fitting. The code
is open source, available on `github
<https://github.com/Gattocrucco/lsqfitgp>`_ under the `GNU General Public
License <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>`_.

Briefly, gaussian processes are a statistical tool for fitting unknown
functions. If you want to know more about gaussian processes, the book
`Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning <http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/>`_
is a good reference available for free. However, understanding the technical
details is not necessary to use the basic functionality of the module.

To start, read the :ref:`installation` section, and then :ref:`sine`.
