def raniter(mean, cov, n=None, eps=None, rng=None):
    """
    
    Take random samples from a multivariate Gaussian.
    
    This generator mimics the interface of `gvar.raniter`, but takes as input
    the mean and covariance separately instead of a collection of gvars.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    mean : scalar, array, or dictionary of scalars/arrays
        The mean of the Gaussian distribution.
    cov : scalar, array, or dictionary of scalars/arrays
        The covariance matrix. If ``mean`` is a dictionary, ``cov`` must be a
        dictionary with pair of keys from ``mean`` as keys.
    n : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations. Default unlimited.
    eps : float, optional
        Used to correct the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to handle
        non-positivity due to roundoff, relative to the largest eigenvalue.
        Default is number of variables times floating point epsilon.
    rng : seed or random generator, optional
        ``rng`` is passed through `numpy.random.default_rng` to produce a random
        number generator.
    
    Yields
    ------
    samp : scalar, array, or dictionary of scalars/arrays
        The random sample in the same format of ``mean``.
    
    Examples
    --------
    
    >>> mean = {'a': np.arange(3)}
    >>> cov = {('a', 'a'): np.eye(3)}
    >>> for sample in lgp.raniter(mean, cov, 3):
    >>>     print(sample)
