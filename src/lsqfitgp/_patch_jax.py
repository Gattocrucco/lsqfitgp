# TODO the current implementation of BufferDict as pytree is not really
# consistent with how JAX handles trees, because JAX expects to be allowed to
# put arbitrary objects in the leaves; in particular, internally it sometimes
# creates dummy trees filled with None. Maybe the current impl is fine with
# this; _buf gets set to None, and assuming the BufferDict is never really
# used in that crooked state, everything goes fine. The thing that this breaks
# is a subsequent flattening of the dummy, I think JAX never does this. (The
# reason for switching to buf-as-leaf in place of dict-values-as-leaves is that
# the latter breaks tracing.)
#
# Maybe since BufferDict is simple and stable, I could read its code, bypass its
# initialization altogether and set all the internal attributes to make it a
# proper pytree but also compatible with tracing.

# TODO try to drop BufferDict altogether. Currently I use it only in bcf and
# bart.
